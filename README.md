# MH-Viz-Shiny-

-Alex Hope

This is a framework for shiny visualizations of mental health attitudes in the technology sector that I created. It contains a varieity of sliders and categorical options to convey heat map and bar chart responses to a variety of mental health outcomes. Useful for anyone looking to visualize culture, age, sex, among other factors and their ties to mental health in the workplace.
